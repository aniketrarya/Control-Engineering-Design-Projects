# Control-Engineering-Design-Projects
The folder contains 12 different mini projects created for the course of control engineering
The mini projects were created with my team members Vedansh garg and Chirag Rathi. We learned about the various aspects of Control Engineering such as:
- Linearising non-linear systems, Ziegler-Nichols for high multiplicity poles and state space equations.
- Learnt about MATLAB and Simulink, PID Tuning, Performance in cascade/feedback and controller design.
